Hi there. I got a lot more responses than I expected for this post. I've filtered them out and here we are!



To help me further refine the list, I'd like to propose this:



I will aware you a 2-hour contract at your proposed rate.
You will write the Playwrite scripts to test the URLs I send you.
You will supply the code (your GitHub is fine).



The test below is obviously pretty simple. Main purpose is to see how you solve this.



Testing:
------
You will test https://giantrocketship.com/
You will verify the page comes up properly
You will navigate to the Contact Us form via the Top Menu
You will submit the following in the Form (1)

Form (1)
------
Name Only : should fail
Name + Email : should fail
Name + Email + Comment : should succeed



The Contact Us form is in an iframe on the Contact Us page.
